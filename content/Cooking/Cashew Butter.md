Just blend some raw cashews (roasted) in a blender or food processor. I used a blender with pre-roasted cashews and it came out pretty good. Use raw cashews and roast them in the oven yourself if you want better consistency and less salt. You can also add vanilla, honey, or something else to make it a bit sweeter.
