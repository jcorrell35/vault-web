We stored most of our outdoors gear inside of it including our camping equipment, fishing gear, extra shoes, and some other backup items. Having the hamburger also made it possible for us to sleep in the car if we needed to or for car camping.

To get ready for the morning drive we packed the RAV besides the things we needed in the morning.
