### Driving to Telluride
In the morning we woke up and it was so much colder than it was when we went to sleep. Our goal was to leave early (6am) so that we had enough time to explore a little more on the way to Cortez, CO which was about 6 hours away. Driving out of the canyons was unreal with the sun rising.

We wanted to have at least one destination on the way to our hotel for the night so we choose to head towards Telluride, CO. On the way we took tons of pictures on pull offs. Taya took even more while we were driving. Since I can't remember exactly where everything was, here is a collage of the drive from Eleven Mile Canyon to Telluride, CO.

Telluride was absolutely the coolest part of our trip so far. This town is absolutely unreal.

We looked for public parking but couldn't really find anything that great (and there was so many cars driving in this small area) so we turned around at the end of the town and made our way back. We wanted to get a view of the mountains so we drove up a mountain where there was a pull off.

### Heading to our hotel in Cortez
We said our goodbyes to Telluride and started heading towards Cortez. We stopped at a beautiful lake on the way, got some more views of the mountains, and drove by a huge reservoir.

Finally, we arrived at our hotel for the night in Cortez, CO. We ordered Dominoes delivery and watched South Park (fitting for Colorado) until we went to sleep.
