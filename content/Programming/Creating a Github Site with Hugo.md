description: (OLD) A little guide/story of how I made this site

*This page is sort of outdated, it was the original way I was developing and deploying the website. It was originally called "This Website" and I was discussing how I built this website. I now use Obsidian to publish this site: [[Using Obsidian, Quartz, and Github Pages to Setup a Simple Static Website]].*

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal/) theme.

Hugo takes [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files and turns them into static web pages. It was written in Go and itâ€™s a great way to develop a great personal website that has simple navigation, tagging features, and easy to use themes.

For my site I went with the Terminal theme. I also decided to use the yaml format for the syntax files. For that, I renamed the default hugo.toml file to hugo.yaml and [changed the syntax to the yaml format](https://he3.app/en/blogs/yaml-to-toml-a-comprehensive-guide-for-developers/).

#### Usual setup for a project looks something like this:
----------
==`hugo new site quickstart && cd quickstart`==

==`git init`==

==`git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke`==

==`echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> hugo.yaml`==

I ran into some issues using this method when it came to deploying the site to GitHub. Therefore I decided to go with a different method for implementing the theme. 

**I ended up copying the files from the theme folder into the base directory:**

![Files](../../images/filesystem.png#img.center)

*This works, however if you want to change the theme at some point it becomes more difficult than just changing it in the hugo.yaml file.*

**I also implemented a simple menu system for the website's navigation:**

![MenuCode](../../images/menucode.png#img.center)

**I applied the following code to the hugo.yaml file:**
==`centerTheme = "true"`==

**I also added a taxonomy called "places to be able to organize posts by location/state. This is also done inside the hugo.yaml file:**

![Taxonomies](../../images/taxonomies.png#img.center)

**Finally, to run the website locally on your machine you can run the following code:**
==`hugo server --buildDrafts`==

*I use the option --buildDrafts to build all blog posts no matter what the status of the draft property is in the file.*

**You can set the draft property to true so your post isn't live until you change the value.**
==`draft: true`==
