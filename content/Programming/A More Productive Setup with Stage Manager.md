title: A More Productive Setup with Stage Manager
---
I often like to have two sets/groups of window screens. One for the development environment with my Notes/VS Code and one for the “end-user environment” with Chrome and Terminal for running Hugo’s local server and viewing my website.

I use stage manager for this and it works really well, however, there is no native way to switch between the stages using a keyboard shortcut. There is only a shortcut for enabling/disabling stage manager.

While I was looking for how to do this I found a stack overflow post that suggested the [Better Touch Tool](https://folivora.ai/). It has a 45-day trial to start and has a very fair price point of $24 for a lifetime license (much less than I thought it was going to be). The tool allows you to assign custom keyboard shortcuts to perform custom actions. I set my keyboard shortcut to be **Alt** + **Tab** and I set the action to move forward through Stage Manager. If you use more than two groups you might want to consider making a shortcut to move backwards through Stage Manager as well.

The tool has a lot more actions and other types of triggers besides just keyboard shortcuts but I have only used it for this one scenario so far. I will update this after my 45-day trial to discuss my experience with it and if it was worth the $24 price point for one trigger/action. If you are interested in what other capabilities Better Touch Tool has check out [their website](https://folivora.ai/).
